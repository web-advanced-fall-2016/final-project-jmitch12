# Final Assignment
###PIPELINE
##### Game created by Jane Mitchell

*Pipeline* is the first in a series of educational STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) mini-games inspired by flow through different systems. 

*Pipeline* is an exploration of a field of engineering called [industrial piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping). A subfield of industrial piping is piping design which focuses on the efficient transport of fluids. In *Pipeline*, the players become piping designers and connect a series of pipes to allow water to flow efficiently through the system. While buiding the system, the player must be mindful of how many pipe resources they use as well as avoiding any obstacles along the way. As the game progresses, player will face enemies as well as the addition of pressure in the system, encouraging quick and efficient piping design.
